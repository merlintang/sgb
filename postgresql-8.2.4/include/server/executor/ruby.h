/*
 * AggStatePerGroupData - per-aggregate-per-group working state
 *
 * These values are working state that is initialized at the start of
 * an input tuple group and updated for each input tuple.
 *
 * In AGG_PLAIN and AGG_SORTED modes, we have a single array of these
 * structs (pointed to by aggstate->pergroup); we re-use the array for
 * each input group, if it's AGG_SORTED mode.  In AGG_HASHED mode, the
 * hash table contains an array of these structs for each tuple group.
 *
 * Logically, the sortstate field belongs in this struct, but we do not
 * keep it here for space reasons: we don't support DISTINCT aggregates
 * in AGG_HASHED mode, so there's no reason to use up a pointer field
 * in every entry of the hashtable.
